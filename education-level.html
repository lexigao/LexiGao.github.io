      There are 7.9 million low-income children in the United States and studies
      show that 83% (6.6 million) of these children are at increased risk of
      dropping out of high school because they can't read proficiently by the
      end of third grade. Researchers say that the ability to read at grade
      level by third grade is crucial to determining whether the student will be
      succeessful in school. Studies had shown that for every student who does
      not complete high school, our society loses an estimated $260,000 in
      earnings, taxes and productivity. Baker, the author of a new report from
      the Learning Policy Institute (LPI), said that a “21.7% increase in
      per-pupil spending throughout all 12 school-age years for children from
      low-income families is large enough to eliminate the education attainment
      gap between children from low-income and non-poor families.” Baker's study
      show that “Increasing per-pupil spending by 10% in all 12 school-age years
      increases probability of high school graduation by 7 percentage points for
      all students, and by roughly 10 percentage points for non-poor children,”
      One of the places where this is a major problem is Philadelphia, PA.
      Research show that 65% of the 4th graders in Pennsylavania are able to
      read at grade level while only 35% of the fourth graders in Philadelphia
      are able to read at grade level. According to the most recent study, 67%
      of the students in Philadelphia graduate on time, 33% are able to read at
      grade level (as measured by state test performance), and only 19% of the
      students meet state standards in math.
