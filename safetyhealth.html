      Students across America are not properly being taught about many of the
      safety and health issues with lead. Many students being as young as 4
      years old and as old as high schoolers are getting ad into their systems
      causog permanent brain damage. Schools should avoid using lead materials
      and paints to prevent the younger students from getting lead poisoning.
      The older students should be aware of such things and not become exposed
      to lead through chipping walls from unproperly cared for walls and
      ceilings. Water fountains should also be required to be filtered properly
      before being used. Over hundreds of thousands have high lead-in-blood
      levels which could be the reason for why this generations general
      knowledge level is lower than the previous.

      Mold is another safety concern
      for many schools. Some schools do well at cleaning out mold within their
      schools however the schools that don't do such a good job may possibly be
      harming their own students by not caring for the building as it should be.
      School food is improving however in the past 5 years there have still been
      too many food poisoning reports from schools only in Philly to be called
      safe. Many parents rely on school meals for their students to eat but they
      are not always aware that what they are eating may cause harm to the
      child. The funding for schools could be used for this but instead funding
      may be going towards other unnecessary things within school or even things
      non-school or safety related.
